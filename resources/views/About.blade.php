        <h2>Important Note</h2>
        <p>Here's what I've managed to accomplish so far. I understand it's not much, and it's likely insufficient to complete the project successfully. Unfortunately, I couldn't do more than this. Additionally, I haven't been able to link the pages together, so accessing them requires using the search bar. However, there are still pages that aren't functioning properly.</p>
        <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>These are the links that are working:</li>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">Welcome Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/games">Show,Create and Edit Games</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/news">News</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/about">About</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pages are not linked together.</li>
            <li>Some pages are not functioning correctly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>

            <li>Address the linking issue to ensure smoother navigation.</li>
            <li>Troubleshoot and fix the malfunctioning pages.</li>
            <li>Continue developing additional features as per project requirements.</li>
